<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to explore my portfolio. Let me share a bit about myself.<br> I have a deep passion for travel, nature, architecture, archaeology, and design. I find pure joy in paddleboarding during the sun-soaked seasons and savoring the city's peaceful charm on rainy days, all accompanied by my favorite music and a steaming cup of coffee. I make it a habit to continuously self-educate and acquire new knowledge within my beloved fields, and this journey constantly makes me feel like I'm leveling up every day.<br> If you'd like to know more about me, please reach out <a href="./contact.html">here</a>.</p>
